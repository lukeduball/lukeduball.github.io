Welcome to my personal blog about programming projects I am working on. I enjoy working on graphics projects with a particular interest in ray marching and ray tracing techniques. Please check out my blog posts and leave any comments or questions you have.

I am a software engineer at Collins Aerospace and work in the Auto-Flight Controls Department in commercial avionics. I graduated from Western Illinois University with my masters in Computer Science and played D1 soccer during my time there. In my free time I enjoy working on personal programming projects and spending my weekend mornings watching Premier League football. My favorite team is Arsenal. Go gooners!
